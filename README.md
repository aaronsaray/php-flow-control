## About

I was creating a multi-step application again - a wizard based system - and I kept thinking that I do this alot, I wish
there was an easier way to do this.  It got even worse when the steps / order of the steps change.  I decided to create
this scaffolding as a way to develop your own process or workflow control in PHP.
